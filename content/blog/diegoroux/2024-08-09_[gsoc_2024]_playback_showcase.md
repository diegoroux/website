# intro
Hello, once again!

# vid?
We made it! I previously stated that we had achieved playback,
but I never got to show it. So here it is, a short video 
showing you that playback actually works.

So you don't have to go and compile it, just to see it on 
action.

[![Video](../playback_showcase.jpg)](../playback_showcase.mov)

# outro
Main functionality is here! So, I believe that it may be
time to maybe push into the main branch.

You can see all my progress at my [fork](https://github.com/diegoroux/haiku/tree/virtio-sound-dev),
within the branch `virtio-sound-dev`.

Until next time.
